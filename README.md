# QSRF - quiet sun radio flux
Quiet sun radio noise is often used for measurements of radio receiving systems. The radio flux from the quiet sun is a known signal in that it is measured and reported at observatories around the earth, and therefore provides a basis of assessment of radio receiving systems.

This project is a script to calculate interpolated recent solar flux data for amateur radio UHF and microwave bands from observations published by NOAA for several solar observatories around the world.

This is a Python batch calculator to provide an alternative to the online calculator previosly published at http://owenduffy.net//calc/qsrf/index.htm and no longer online.

The original web page is in the old folder for documentation, but the calculator will not run.
